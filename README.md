# Prerequisites

You will need Java 11 to build and run the Rad Shipment Calculator.  The version provided by [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) is an excellent choice for this.  Everything else, including Gradle, will be downloaded by the build process.

# Description

Rad Shipment Calculator is a tool to calculate a radioactive shipment's shipping level with ease. Note that one must always double check the calculations as the rules and regulations may change. This project started off as a work-study job for the Radiation Safety Laboratory at the Univerisity of Massachusetts Lowell. This is an ongoing project and will be updated constantly.
